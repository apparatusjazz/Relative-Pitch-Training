# Relative-Pitch-Training

A music relative pitch game. A reference note is played and the user must guess the note that is played when clicking play note.

Future plans:

Will have difficulty levels and multiple notes playes in succession. Chords are also a possibility. Will put an expanded range of two plus octaves.
